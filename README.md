# Constructor

A Lua Script for the Stand mod menu for GTA5

Allows for creation of custom vehicles and maps using the in-game props and vehicles, and sharing your creations, and loading others creations.

## Easy Install

The current stable version of Constructor is available via the Stand Lua Script Respository at (Stand > Lua Scripts > Repository > Constructor).
This version is slightly slower to get updates, but is also less likely to have issues.

Alternatively, you can use ScriptManager to Constructor (and many other scripts)

1. Download and install [ScriptManager](https://github.com/hexarobi/stand-lua-scriptmanager/raw/main/ScriptManagerInstaller.exe)
2. In game, goto `Stand > Lua Scripts > ScriptManager > Install Scripts > Constructor > Install`

## Manual install

#### Script

Constructor will auto-update itself, so the main script file is all that is needed to install.

1. Download [the script file](https://github.com/hexarobi/stand-lua-constructor/raw/main/Constructor.lua)
2. Copy into your `Stand/Lua Scripts` folder as `Constructor.lua`

#### Full Project

If the above methods fail, you can manually install the entire project using this method.

1. Download [the projects zip archive file](https://github.com/hexarobi/stand-lua-constructor/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
2. Extract the contents of `stand-lua-constructor-main` into your `Stand/Lua Scripts` folder
2. Run by going to `Stand > Lua Scripts > Constructor`.

## Loading Constructs

1. Select `Load Constructs` from the main menu.
2. If your `Stand/Constructs` folder is empty, then and you will be prompted to download and install a [curated collection of construct files](https://github.com/hexarobi/stand-curated-constructs), including popular vehicles, maps, and player skins. These can also be installed or updated at any time from the `Load Constructs > Options` menu.
3. Browse the curated collection and select a construct to spawn it into the game world and add it to your `Loaded Constructs` menu for editing.
4. Any additional construct files (vehicles, maps, or player skins in either `json`, `xml` or `ini` format) can be saved into your `Stand/Constructs` folder. You can organize this folder, and optional sub-folders, however you wish.

## Creating New Constructs

1. Select `Create New Construct` from the main menu.
2. To create using your current vehicle as the base select `From Current Vehicle`. This will add it to your `Loaded Constructs` menu for editing.
3. Select `Add Attachment > Search` and enter in a search term such as "tree"
4. Browse search results and select a tree to attach to your vehicle
5. Use the `Position` menu to move the tree attachment into an appropriate position
6. Use the `Options` menu to modify various attributes about the attachment, including visibility, collision, and invincibility.
7. Use `Add Attachment` to attach another attachment to the tree attachment, maybe one the curated objects, or try searching "art"
8. Try using `Add Attachment` to attach another vehicle to the base vehicle and explore the various vehicle options
9. Try using `Add Attachment` to add a pedestrian (ped) and explore the ped options, including clothing and animations
10. Continue explopring, building, and having fun
11. Save your construct and share it with others on Dicord! =)

## Updating

The script will check for updates the first time it is run each day. If updates are found they will be auto-downloaded from https://github.com/hexarobi/stand-lua-constructor and auto-installed. You can manually check for updates any time within the Script Meta menu.
